## Hi, My name is Eric Alejandro Durante ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate developer deeply immersed in the world of Django and cybersecurity.

Currently, I manage two websites:

- [lifyxapp.com](https://lifyxapp.com) - An application to convert XML files to PDF files.
- [cruza.lifyxapp.com](https://cruza.lifyxapp.com) - An application to adopt pets.
- [ticketo.lifyxapp.com](https://ticketo.lifyxapp.com) - An application for buying event tickets.

If you'd like to hear more about how I developed these projects or see the code, feel free to email me at eric.alejandro.durante@gmail.com or send me a message on my LinkedIn: [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-alejandro-durante-971a77233/).
